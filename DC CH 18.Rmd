### (1.)

Variables: Built Before/After 1988, Bathrooms, Fireplace, # of houses, price, square feet.

### (2.)

Yes, the number of bathrooms changes the price. For more than 1.5 bathrooms, the price is 179796, While the price for a house with less than 1.5 bathrooms is 151424

### (3.)

The difference between prices is 179796 - 151424 which equals
28372

### (4.)

Based on the prices with or without a fireplace, it appears there is an association.  But there are other variables that impact the price, like the square footage being more or less than 2816 sqft.
